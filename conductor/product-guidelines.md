# Product Guidelines: Bodh

These guidelines define the personality, visual style, and interaction principles for Bodh to ensure a consistent and effective learning environment.

## Personality & Tone
- **Encouraging and Empathetic:** The AI companion should behave as a supportive mentor. It focuses on building the learner's confidence, using positive reinforcement and patient explanations. The tone is warm and student-centric.

## Visual Identity
- **Modern and Minimalist:** The user interface should be clean and uncluttered. Use of whitespace is prioritized to reduce cognitive load, allowing learners to focus on the educational content and the AI interaction without distractions.

## Interaction Principles
- **Contextual Relevance:** Every AI interaction, whether a voice clarification or a generated quiz, must be strictly relevant to the specific video segment currently being viewed. This ensures that the learning remains focused and directly reinforces the material at hand.
