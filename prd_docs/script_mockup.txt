Final Script-Lesson 2


Lesson 2 Script for Mockup (Timestamped)
A. Pre-video Warm-up (Revision of Lesson 1) — 2–3 questions
Step A1 — Warm-up Prompt (Before video starts)
Trigger: Student clicks Lesson 2 → video is loaded but not playing
AI (Voice + Text):
“Before Lesson 2, let’s do a quick warm-up from Lesson 1: Datasets.
Just 3 questions. It’ll take 30 seconds.”
Buttons:
* “Start warm-up”
* “Skip”
________________


Step A2 — Warm-up Q1 (Student attempts)
On-screen:
Warm-up Q1/3
“In Lesson 1, why did we simplify the report card?”
Options:
A) To make it look nicer
B) ✅ To keep only fields needed for computation
C) To remove marks
D) To add more subjects
Student action: Select option (click / voice)
AI feedback (Voice + Text):
“Correct. We simplify data to remove distractions and keep what we need for answering questions.”
Button: “Next”
________________


Step A3 — Warm-up Q2
Warm-up Q2/3
“Which dataset included: item name, type, quantity, unit price, total cost?”
Options:
A) Report cards
B) ✅ Shopping bills
C) Paragraph words
D) None
AI feedback:
“Right — shopping bills are structured like rows with totals.”
Button: “Next”
________________


Step A4 — Warm-up Q3 (Bridge)
Warm-up Q3/3
“In the paragraph dataset, why do we assign a sequence number to each word card?”
Options:
A) To know the author
B) ✅ Words repeat; sequence helps count each occurrence separately
C) To calculate GST
D) To alphabetically sort words
AI feedback:
“Exactly. Now in Lesson 2, we’ll learn the computation pattern that processes these cards systematically.”
Button: “Continue to video”

B. Main Lesson Video + Conversational Interruptions
Step B1 — Video starts (00:00)
Timestamp: 00:00
Action: Video plays normally.
________________


1) Student Doubt Mid-video (User pauses and asks AI)
Step B2 — Student pauses and asks a doubt (example)
Suggested timestamp for mockup: 01:10
(They are struggling with manual counting; student can naturally get confused)
Student action: Click Pause and ask via mic/text
Student question:
“Why do they keep saying ‘start again’? Can’t we just continue from where we stopped?”
AI answer (Voice + Text):
“That’s the point — with manual counting, you don’t have a reliable memory of progress.
If you lose track, you may repeat numbers or skip cards.
So you need a method that stores progress in a variable (like count) so you can continue anytime without restarting.”
AI follow-up:
“Want a tiny example?”
Buttons:
* “Yes, show example”
* “Continue video”
If Yes → show a small visual in center (not video):
* count = 0
* see 1st card → count = 1
* see 2nd card → count = 2
* pause → resume → continue from 2
Button: “Resume video”


Step B2.1 Multilingual Conversation
Timestamp: 05:10
Action: Student clicks Pause on video
Student Question (Voice or Text Input)
Student (Hindi / Hinglish):
“Mujhe simple language mein yeh concept dobara samjhaiye.”
AI (Voice + Text):
“Bilkul. Simple language mein samjhte hain.”
“Socho tumhare paas cards ka ek pile hai.”
“Tum ek-ek card uthate ho.”
“Har baar jab tum ek card uthate ho, tum ek number yaad rakhte ho.”
“Shuru mein number hota hai zero.”
“Pehla card dekha → number ek ho gaya.”
“Doosra card dekha → number do ho gaya.”
“Is process ko kehte hain iteration.”
“Aur jo number tum yaad rakh rahe ho — usse kehte hain variable.”[a]

2) AI Detects “Prof asks a question” → Auto pause + learner response
Step B3 — Auto-pause: “Prof asks a question” 
Timestamp: 08:27→ Video auto pauses
AI: “The professor has asked a question here.
Do you want to think first before continuing with the video?

Question: “What is a good thing to check? Suppose I want average maths marks. How do you compute average maths marks for the class?””
Options:
A) Max mark ÷ number of students
B) ✅ Sum of maths marks ÷ count of students
C) Count of students ÷ sum
D) Pick the middle mark
AI feedback:
“Correct. Average = sum ÷ count. 
AI: Now watch how they compute sum systematically.”
Button: “Continue video” (Automatically the video resumes)

3) Concept Completion → Auto pause + Formative Assessment


Concept Completion #1: Iteration + variable (count) structure explained
Timestamp: 05:59
(They summarize: initialization, step update, stopping condition)
Concept Completion #2: Accumulation + average (sum + count) completed
Timestamp: 11:11
(They compute average and explain accumulation)
Concept Completion #3: Filtering + filtered iteration introduced
Timestamp: 16:40
(They define filtering and filtered iteration)


Step C1 — Concept Completion Pause #1 (Iteration basics)
Timestamp: 05:59
Auto-pause overlay: “Concept Check: Iteration Pattern”
AI (Voice + Text):
“You’ve completed the first concept: Iteration with a variable.
Quick check — answer 2 questions.”

“What is the initialization step in their counting example?”
A) count = 1
B) ✅ count = 0
C) count = 30
D) count = -1
Formative Q2 (MCQ):
“When do we stop the iteration?”

B) ✅ When the first pile becomes empty (all cards moved)
C) When we feel tired
D) When we find the top scorer
Buttons:
* “Submit”
* “Skip”
AI feedback:
“Nice. You understood the loop: start → repeat update → stop when data ends.”
Button: “Resume video”
________________


Step C2 — Concept Completion Pause #2 (Average + Accumulation)
Timestamp: 11:11
Auto-pause overlay: “Concept Check: Sum & Average”
AI (Voice + Text):
“Concept completed: Accumulation using sum + using count to compute average.”

“Their final values were: sum = 2171, count = 30.
What is the correct formula for average?”
A) count ÷ sum
B) ✅ sum ÷ count
C) sum + count
D) sum × count
AI feedback (after submit):
